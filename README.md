# Covid-19-Data-Analysis-using-Machine-Learning
The pandemic has already taken grip over peoplesâ€™ life. Since the start of the pandemic, some countries are facing problem of ever-increasing cases. Through the data analysis of cases one can analyse how countries all over the world are doing in terms of controlling the pandemic. Analysing data leads to adapt the prevention model of the countries that are doing great in terms of lowering the graph. Predictions are made with the dataset available to the individual/country/organisations, thus helping them to decide how far they are able to control the pandemic or up to how much extent they should guide preventive measures. Through this project, a step towards helping people to understand the spread and predict the cases in their country is done. This project also gives an insight of how a country is doing in terms of limiting the spread
